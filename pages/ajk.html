It is known for its stunning landscapes, lush green valleys, and serene lakes, such as Neelum Valley and Rawalakot.

AJK's capital, Muzaffarabad, serves as a cultural and administrative center, and the region is home to several historical sites, including the Red Fort and Pir Chinasi, which draw both tourists and pilgrims.</p>
